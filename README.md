# Genetic-Algorithm
This is a Machine Learning algorithm also known as The Genetic Algorithm that uses nature's natural selection process. 
It is able to achieve a specific target by performing a series of natural selections driven by improvement in future generations. 
In this mini-project Genetic Algorithm is used to evolve a random string into a particular sentence.
